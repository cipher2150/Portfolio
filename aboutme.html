                        Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Geopolitics
                    </h2>
                    <p>Passionate about exploring how technology shapes global power dynamics, international relations, and geographic landscapes. I analyze the impact of emerging technologies—such as AI, space exploration, and digital infrastructure—on national security, economic strategies, and diplomatic policies. My interest extends to areas like cyber warfare, data sovereignty, and the role of tech giants in influencing geopolitical alliances. By combining technology and global affairs, I aim to understand how innovations redefine borders, governance, and conflicts in the modern world.</p>
